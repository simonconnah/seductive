            You now need to confirm your email address by clicking on the link in the email that you have just been
            sent. Until you have confirmed your email address your account will remain in an inactive state.

            If you have any questions at all or just want to provide some feedback then by all means
            <a href="{{ contact_us }}">contact us</a> and we will attempt to get back to you as soon as possible.
