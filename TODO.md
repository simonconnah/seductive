TODO for seductive blog platform

* Find a way to distribute themes as the current templates are all geared towards to my own personal website. I'd like
  to see something that would be a good starting location for people who might not be that technical so they only have
  to change a bit of text here and there.

* Add social login

* Minify and compress CSS / JS assets

* Look into possible caching solutions for extra speed

* Make sure that all technical details for SEO are implemented. Then it is down to the user to create compelling content
  but at least the seductive blogging platform will be able to handle as much as it can.

* Change all instances of Beautiful and Alluring in templates to {{ site_name }}.

* Add a way for people to vote on comments

* Show date and time information for comments

* Add a system that allows users to flag a comment by review
